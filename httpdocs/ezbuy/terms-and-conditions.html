&#8226; If you are a senior citizen, the only way you can purchase your sticker online with Senior discount ($30) is with a renewal form that contains your renewal application number. <br />

&#8226; If you do not have a senior renewal application form or application number and want to purchase the senior citizen discount sticker ($30), you must purchase your sticker in person or through the mail and provide documentation (e.g., valid IL driver's license) that proves you are 65 years of age or older.
<br />
<br />
&#8226; If you are attempting to purchase Daily Residential Parking Permits for the first time in the 2012-2013 city sticker renewal year and this purchase is not in conjunction with a city vehicle sticker purchase, you must visit a City Clerk facility and provide proof of residency to obtain your passes. <br />
