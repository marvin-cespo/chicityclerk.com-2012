Create something great and list it on the CSA site!   Revenue sharing offered for premium add-on packs.
If they are 100% ready-to-go the revenue split is 75% to the plugin author, 25% is retained for payment processing fees and marketing expenses.

= Support =

Support for the plugin can be found in the [CSA Forums](http://www.charlestonsw.com/forums/).  If you have an urgent issue or want one-on-one support you can [purchase premium support](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product/product-support).

You can also view the [CSA Product Documentation](http://www.charlestonsw.com/support/documentation) for more information about the plugin including [known conflicts](http://www.charlestonsw.com/support/documentation/technical-documentation/store-locator-plus/troubleshooting/known-conflicts/) with themes and plugins.

= Special Requests =

I accept feature requests for all plugins. The most requested features will make it into the next version if time permits.

If you need something NOW, or are looking for something beyond a basic "tweak" of the plugin, please check out the
[Customization Service](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product/customization/).  

= Upgrades and Patches =

I try to release at least one upgrade/patch every month.

The main product will always remain fully functional and free.
If you'd like to have some of the latest "bells & whistles" purchasing a premium add-on is a great way to help support me and encourage even more items get added the next time around.

= My Philosophy =

I strive to create code that runs efficiently and without bugs.
In my opinion, well-written plugins are few and far between.
While there are plenty of plugins that look nice, far too many of those plugins, including the "cool shiny ones" have too many hidden problems.
I have found that over 90% of the plugins available on the WordPress plugin directory generate dozens, if not hundreds, of warnings and errors when you turn off the "hide all the problems" settings.

These hidden problems impact memory usage, fill up disk space, and reduce performance via the typical default logging settings.
While you may not see the errors on your WordPress site, they are still being tracked.
The more errors, the more disk I/O, the slower the app.

During 20+ years of software development, I have found that leaving "innocuous" warnings in place tends to lead to trouble further down the road.
Warnings today often become errors tomorrow.
Many programming languages, PHP included, continue to tighten security and close loopholes that are typically found living near all those warning messages.
Some warnings are telling you to "change this now, it will be gone tomorrow".
Eventually tomorrow will come.

While my plugins may not be the prettiest on the block, I do try to make sure that all the hidden stuff you don't see is designed as well as it can be.
My code is not perfect, but when I find a bug I try to fix it fast. 
If I create a bug I try to fix it even faster.
To sum it all up, I like to write plugins that last.
I hope you appreciate my work.

= Rate This Plugin =

Please [rate this plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/store-locator-le/)!
Rating the plugin, hopefully with 5 stars, helps increase the exposure on WordPress, which generates more downloads and purchases of add-ons.
The more add-ons I sell the easier it is to put food on the table and give me more time to code cool new features.
No ratings, no food, more hours working as the Walmart Greeter, less coolness in the plugins.

Give me a chance to address your concerns if this plugin doesn't earn 5 stars by [contacting me](http://www.charlestonsw.com/mindset/contact-us/) directly or by posting in the [support forum](http://www.charlestonsw.com/forums/) at the CSA website.

= Help Me "Speak" Your Language =

Help me with translating the English words and phrases in the plugin and I will give you a premium add-on.
The base plugin and the premium add-on packs have been updated to work with most language translation tools including the [Codestyling Localization]() plugin.
[Contact me](http://www.charlestonsw.com/mindset/contact-us/) if you have a newly translated .po and .mo file to submit.
If I do not have the language files already, or if they were notably out-of-date, I will add the premium add-on pack of your choice to your account.
Upon request I will also put a link to your site in the "special thanks" section.

Any EASIER way to perform translations?  Load the [Codestyling Localization plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codestyling-localization/) and then find it under "Tools/Localization" in your admin panel.

= Version 4 Major Upgrade =

Version 4 is the first major upgrade in a couple of years.
This upgrade provides new features that make it far easier to create a truly custom user experience without having to leave the WordPress admin panel.
You can learn more about the new release at the [Charleston Software Associates](http://www.charlestonsw.com) web site.

= Important Note About Version 3 Premium Add Ons =

*Make sure all of your premium add-on packs are version 4.X or higher.*

If you are using premium add-on packs for Store Locator Plus version 3 you must first upgrade to the Store Locator Plus 4 compatible add-on packs.
Do not upgrade the base plugin if you are using SLP3 add-on packs.   You must follow these instructions:

    * Login to your [Charleston Software Associates](http://www.charlestonsw.com) account.
    * Purchase [the SLP4 compatible version of your add-on packs](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product-category/slp4-products/).
    * Download the SLP4 add-on pack zip files.
    * Login to your website's WordPress admin panel.
    * Deactivate and delete all of your SLP premium add-on packs.
    * Upgrade Store Locator Plus to SLP version 4.x.
    * Install your newly downloaded SLP4 add-on pack zip files.
    * Active the newly installed add-on packs.

== Installation ==

= Requirements =

* PHP 5.2.4+ (same as WordPress 3.3.2)
* WordPress: 3.3.2+

= Main Plugin =

1. Search for "Store Locator Plus" via Plugins/Add New on your WordPress admin panel.
2. Click install.
3. Add your locations through the 'Add Locations' page in the Store Locator admin panel
4. Create or edit a page and add the [SLPLUS] shortcode.

= Icons =

The system ships with a dozen default icons in the `/wp-content/plugins/store-locator-le/images/icons` directory. Add your own custom icons in that directory and they will be auto-detected.

To prevent custom icons from being over-written they will be copies to the '/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/custom-icons/' directory.  If you place your icons in that directory they will be detected on the icon selection screens.

= Custom Styling =

Users that want to customize the look and feel of the search form, map, and search results can do so
with ease using the built-in Theme System.   Copy an existing CSS file,
change the file name and update the CSS header, upload to the server and you can now activate your
new theme or any of the built-in defaults by selecting it from the auto-generated pulldown menu.

[Pro Pack](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product/slp4-pro/) users can also add CSS rules via the Pro Pack CSS Rules entry on the admin panel.

= What are the premium add-ons? =

In response to feature requests from customers, I created a series of premium add-on packages for Store Locator Plus.
These features extend the functionality of the plugin beyond the basic service and features and can be purchased ala-carte.
This gives those customers who want more out of the plugin the extra features they desire while keeping the main plugin as
efficient as possible for everyone else.   It also provides a great way to support future development while getting a
"little something extra" when contributing to my efforts.

All plugins are true add-on packs.  They are non-destructive OPTIONAL additions to the base plugin.
They do not require the base plugin to be uninstalled or re-installed.
Installed an add-on pack will not change location data or modify base plugin settings.

on the [CSL License Terms page](http://www.charlestonsw.com/products/general-eula/).

= How can I translate the plugin into my language? =

* The easiest way to start the process it by installing the [CodeStyling Localization](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codestyling-localization/) plugin.
